        Retrieve the output and metadata of a run. When a notebook task returns

        the first 5 MB of the output. To return a larger result, you can store
        job results in a cloud storage service.

        This endpoint validates that the run_id parameter is valid and returns
        an HTTP status code 400 if the run_id parameter is invalid.

        Runs are automatically removed after 60 days. If you to want to
        reference them beyond 60 days, you must save old run results before they
        expire. To export using the UI, see Export job run results. To export
        using the Jobs API, see Runs export.

            Set this value if you want to be able to execute multiple runs of
            the same job concurrently. This is useful for example if you trigger
            your job on a frequent schedule and want to allow consecutive runs
            to overlap with each other, or if you want to trigger multiple runs
            which differ by their input parameters.


            This setting affects only new runs. For example, suppose the job’s
            concurrency is 4 and there are 4 concurrent active runs. Then
            setting the concurrency to 3 won’t kill any of the active runs.
            However, from then on, new runs are skipped unless there are fewer
            than 3 active runs.


            This value cannot exceed 1000\. Setting this value to 0 causes all
            new runs to be skipped. The default behavior is to allow only 1
            concurrent run.

            types. Legacy node types cannot specify custom EBS volumes. For node
            types with no instance store, at least one EBS volume needs to be
            specified; otherwise, cluster creation fails.


            These EBS volumes are mounted at `/ebs0`, `/ebs1`, and etc. Instance
            store volumes are mounted at `/local_disk0`, `/local_disk1`, and
            etc.


            If EBS volumes are attached, Databricks configures Spark to use only
            the EBS volumes for scratch storage because heterogeneously sized
            scratch devices can lead to inefficient disk utilization. If no EBS
            volumes are attached, Databricks configures Spark to use instance
            store volumes.

            `spark.local.dir` is overridden.

        retrieved from the provided repository. For Jar, Egg, and Whl libraries,
        this step is a no-op.

        * `INSTALLING`: The library is actively being installed, either by
        adding resources to Spark or executing system commands inside the Spark
        nodes.

        * `INSTALLED`: The library has been successfully instally.

        * `SKIPPED`: Installation on a Databricks Runtime 7.0 or above cluster
        was skipped due to Scala version incompatibility.

        * `FAILED`: Some step in installation failed. More information can be
        found in the messages field.

        * `UNINSTALL_ON_RESTART`: The library has been marked for removal.
        Libraries can be removed only when clusters are restarted, so libraries
        that enter this state remains until the cluster is restarted.

          description: >-
            An optional token that can be used to guarantee the idempotency of
            job run requests. If an active run with the provided token already
            exists, the request does not create a new run, but returns the ID of
            the existing run instead.


            If you specify the idempotency token, upon failure you can retry
            until the request succeeds. Databricks guarantees that exactly one
            run is launched with that idempotency token.


            This token must have at most 64 characters.

            jobs](https://kb.databricks.com/jobs/jobs-idempotency.html).
