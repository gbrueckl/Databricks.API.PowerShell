    "This feature is in
    [Public Preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/release-notes/release-types).\n
   
    **Important:** To access Azure Databricks REST APIs, you must [authenticate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/sql/api/authentication)."

      "In general, there is little need to modify dashboards using the API. However, it can be useful to use dashboard objects to look-up a collection of related query IDs. The API can also be used to duplicate multiple dashboards at once since you can get a dashboard definition with a GET request and then POST it to create a new one."
  - name: ACL / Permissions
    description: 
      "The SQL Permissions API is similar to the endpoints of the [Permissions API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/dev-tools/api/latest/permissions). However, this exposes only one endpoint, which gets the Access Control List for a given object. You cannot modify any permissions using this API.\n
    
    There are three levels of permission:\n

      - `CAN_VIEW`: Allows read-only access\n

      - `CAN_RUN`: Allows read access and run access (superset of `CAN_VIEW`)\n

      - `CAN_MANAGE`: Allows all actions: read, run, edit, delete, modify permissions (superset of `CAN_RUN`)"

servers:
  - url: https://<databricks-instance>/api/2.0/sql
    description: >-
      In the URL, substitute `<databricks-instance>` with the `adb-<workspace-id>.<random-number>.azuredatabricks.net` domain name of your Azure Databricks deployment.
